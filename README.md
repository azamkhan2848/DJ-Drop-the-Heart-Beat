build a deep learning algorithm that can classify life-threatening VAs with only the labeled one-channel intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) sensed by single-chamber Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) while satisfying the requirements of in-time detection on the resource-constrained microcontroller (MCU) platform (cortex-M4 NUCLEO-L432KC).
